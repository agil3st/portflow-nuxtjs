## Welcome to Portflow x NuxtJS

**Portflow** is a portfolio web template build with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). By using [NuxtJS](https://nuxt.com/) v3, this will take care of the rest of _repeatable components, enable rich-content, quick navigation, optimize page speed and dynamic SEO friendly_. So this way more **recommended** for production purpose. For now, **Portflow** only provide page layouts for simple Article or Blog UI like [Medium](https://medium.com/). Any future development update will be announced on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agil3st/) profile.

> Portflow may contains another combination of components from [TailwindCSS Components](https://tailwindcomponents.com/) and DaisyUI Components
